# RaspberryPi-VisibleLightCommunication-Python
 Visibile Light Communication Project with Raspberry Pi and Python programming Language

# Description
 Visible Light Communication is an Optical Communication Project in Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS) that using visible light to communicate data from transmitter to receiver. Visible Light are generated by LED and received by PhotoDiode. This Project Are using 2 Raspberry Pi as transmitter and receiver. 

## requirements
Python3
RPi.GPIO


## Circuit
For transmitter:
